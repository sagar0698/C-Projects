# Hangman

In this game of Hangman, the computer will randomly choose a name of a country from a given list. This word is the answer. The objective for the player is to try and guess the word the computer randomly chose, by guessing each letter one at a time. Whenever the user guesses a letter that is in the answer, all occurrences of that letter are revealed to the user. The game ends when the user has guessed every letter in the word, before he reaches the allowed number of strikes (usually 5). The focus is to use and manipulate strings and loops.
