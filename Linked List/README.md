# Singly Linked List

Here is a Linked List that allows the user to input as many integers as they want. After the user enters all the data in the list, the getInteger() function is used to locate a particular integer within the list. The user is asked to input a position and if the number is found, it would output what number lies in that position, otherwise it would output -1 if there is no integer. After that, the maxList() and Max() function is used to locate the largest number within the list. 

**Example #1:**
Enter number of integers : 5

Enter 5 integers

1 2 -1 4 5

5 4 -1 2 1

Enter position of integer to find : 2

Integer at position entered is: -1

The largest value in the list is: 5
