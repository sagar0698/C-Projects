# Recursion

This program is a review to recursions and how they work. The definition of a recursion is when a function is called within the same function. If a function that calls itself, and doesn't perform the task that the function calls is called the tail recursion. For this program, I use recursive functions to preform certain functions like finding positive integers, the range, maximum, minimum, sum, and product.

int countPositive(int *array, int first, int last); int countRange(int *array, int first, int last);

int getMaximum(int *array, int first, int last); int getMinimum(int *array, int first, int last);

int getSum(int *array, int first, int last); int getProduct(int *array, int first, int last);
