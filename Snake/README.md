** Snake Game **

This is a old classic game called Snake. The objective for this game is to collect fruits or in this case, symbols, without hitting any of the barriers and/or having the snake eat its own tail. The game is operated using the arrow keys and I hope you enjoy playing this game.

This program consists of a class which consist of functions. These functions are:
field - creating the platform/map
food - represented as the symbols (#, @)
set_pos - sets positions for the x and y coordinates
reposition - using a randomize function that randomly picks where the symbol will be placed
get_input - setting up the arrow keys to function the game
move - allows the snake to move
